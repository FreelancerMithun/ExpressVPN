Virtual Private Networks now abound and try to get the attention of their target markets. If you’ve been approached by VPN experts claiming that they have the best VPN available, how do you know whether it’s true? It’s a struggle to weed out the good VPNs from the bad, and we here will try our very best to review a specific VPN company.

At first look Express VPN provides amazing promise and potential; we look at the specifics and find out if its features are worth our time and resources. For an in depth review of ExpressVPN, read on.

Express VPN is a VPN that has the three main components we look for in any <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2403388,00.asp">VPN service provider</a>: high speed, security, ease of use. It’s great to note that as long as the internet speed is fast, all the services of Express VPN run smoothly. We break down some of the best experiences we’ve had with this particular VPN.
<h3>1. Viewing videos from remote locations.</h3>
This is where Express VPN really takes the cash. Users can watch TV content from practically anywhere with the use of their account. It takes ultra fast speeds and a lot of VPN capabilities to be able to provide this feature. Express VPN does not fail at all.
<h3>2. Online Privacy.</h3>
There are many VPN service providers that claim that they can secure the identity of their users. The sad truth is that most of the security features in place are outdated; phishing schemes are ever evolving, and if the security features do not evolve just as fast, then users can never be assured that their private information is safe.

With Express VPN, users’ internet traffic is encrypted. IP addresses are concealed and this is the first step towards total protection from phishing scams. Hackers and spies will fail to claim any valuable information about you, such as your credit card details, current location, and most importantly, the details of your property (if you’re using VPN to monitor your property from a remote location).expressvpn most popular plan is 12 month,expressvpn offering 49% discount code for 12 months package. that's why this is the most popular package.You can take advantage of ExpressVPN's three-month free trial <a href="https://vpnstart.com/expressvpn-coupon-code/">offer by visiting vpnstart.com</a>


3. Online freedom. Express VPN provides a way for users to view any website – even websites with censorship. Applications that have censorship features are also unlocked, giving users the ultimate freedom to browse all four corners for the World Wide Web.

The best thing about Express VPN is that the set up is very straightforward. After users sign up, install, and connect, they can now use the VPN from their chosen device – PC, laptop, tablet, or smart phone.

Express VPN’s customer support is very efficient too. Round the clock customer support is available, so it doesn’t really matter if you’re in New York or Johannesburg or Tokyo or Sydney. Someone from their customer service team will be there for you to take your call. The scope of Express VPN’s coverage is ever increasing, with now over 136 VPN locations. These locations are spread across 87 countries.

In the very unlikely event that users find something that they are not satisfied with, they can have their entire payment refunded to them within the<a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/features/money-back-guarantee"> 30 day period</a>. That’s how confident the guys at Express VPN are. True enough, we didn’t ask for a refund.

At the end of the day, Express VPN appears to have lived up to its claims. Users should definitely give this service provider a try.
